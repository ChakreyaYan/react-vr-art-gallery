Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an idealized village.  It has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941, acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest. It is regarded as among Van Gogh's finest works and is one of the most recognized paintings in the history of Western culture.","key":"caption","title":"Caption","type":"textarea","children":null}],"bucket":"5a329f6769a130011900000c","type_slug":"paintings","created_at":"2017-12-14T16:03:18.228Z","created_by":"56d66b2f903a79b904000001","created":"2017-12-14T16:03:18.228Z","user_id":"56d66b2f903a79b904000001","options":{"content_editor":0,"slug_field":1},"status":"published","modified_at":"2018-05-09T01:32:34.175Z","modified_by":"56d66b2f903a79b904000001","publish_at":null,"published_at":"2018-05-09T01:32:34.175Z"},{"_id":"5a35f303563c9e17300001e3","order":2,"slug":"back-painting","title":"Back Painting","content":"","metafields":[{"value":"14243420-e2e3-11e7-9aa4-211f05a885ee-wave.jpg","key":"painting","title":"Painting","type":"file","children":null},{"value":"The Great Wave off Kanagawa (神奈川沖浪裏 Kanagawa-oki nami ura, \"Under a wave off Kanagawa\"), also known as The Great Wave or simply The Wave, is a woodblock print by the Japanese ukiyo-e artist Hokusai. It was published sometime between 1829 and 1833 in the late Edo period as the first print in Hokusai's series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. It is Hokusai's most famous work, and one of the most recognizable works of Japanese art in the world.\n\nThe image depicts an enormous wave threatening boats off the coast of the town of Kanagawa (the present-day city of Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture). While sometimes assumed to be a tsunami, the wave is more likely to be a large rogue wave. As in all the prints in the series, it depicts the area around Mount Fuji under particular conditions, and the mountain itself appears in the background.","key":"caption","title":"Caption","type":"textarea","children":null}],"bucket":"5a329f6769a130011900000c","type_slug":"paintings","created_at":"2017-12-17T04:30:59.671Z","created_by":"56d66b2f903a79b904000001","created":"2017-12-17T04:30:59.671Z","user_id":"56d66b2f903a79b904000001","options":{"content_editor":0,"slug_field":1},"status":"published","modified_at":"2018-05-07T17:58:29.816Z","modified_by":"56d66b2f903a79b904000001","publish_at":null,"published_at":"2018-05-07T17:58:29.816Z"}],"media":[{"_id":"5a329f92aaca32410f000174","name":"94f28b40-e0e7-11e7-a7c5-237bbb3de98d-mona.jpg","original_name":"mona.jpg","size":130603,"type":"image/jpeg","bucket":"5a329f6769a130011900000c","created":"2017-12-14T15:58:10.050Z","location":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cosmicjs","folder":null},{"_id":"5a32a0c5aaca32410f00017d","name":"4c37f6a0-e0e8-11e7-a7c5-237bbb3de98d-starry.jpg","original_name":"starry.jpg","size":893036,"type":"image/jpeg","bucket":"5a329f6769a130011900000c","created":"2017-12-14T16:03:17.582Z","location":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cosmicjs","folder":null},{"_id":"5a35f302563c9e17300001e2","name":"14243420-e2e3-11e7-9aa4-211f05a885ee-wave.jpg","original_name":"wave.jpg","size":126192,"type":"image/jpeg","bucket":"5a329f6769a130011900000c","created":"2017-12-17T04:30:58.266Z","location":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cosmicjs","folder":null},{"_id":"5aef8ff4be237e7c2744f1a4","name":"628eb520-5185-11e8-8827-cfcc205f846c-KZNTEn2r6tw.jpg","original_name":"KZNTEn2r6tw.jpg","size":4178511,"type":"image/jpeg","bucket":"5a329f6769a130011900000c","created":"2018-05-06T23:29:56.623Z","location":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cosmicjs","url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cosmicjs/628eb520-5185-11e8-8827-cfcc205f846c-KZNTEn2r6tw.jpg","imgix_url":"https://cosmic-s3.imgix.net/628eb520-5185-11e8-8827-cfcc205f846c-KZNTEn2r6tw.jpg","folder":null},{"_id":"5af08011b430b2229218cc42","name":"812ddc10-5214-11e8-baad-1f737c28d160-rKE6rXOl14U.jpg","original_name":"rKE6rXOl14U.jpg","size":2574330,"type":"image/jpeg","bucket":"5a329f6769a130011900000c","created":"2018-05-07T16:34:25.714Z","location":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cosmicjs","url":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cosmicjs/812ddc10-5214-11e8-baad-1f737c28d160-rKE6rXOl14U.jpg","imgix_url":"https://cosmic-s3.imgix.net/812ddc10-5214-11e8-baad-1f737c28d160-rKE6rXOl14U.jpg","folder":null}],"extensions":[{"id":"20b6ef00-5185-11e8-a1e2-bb8ce648f497","cosmic_extension_id":"5ae8e281e663ea6f69d0f433","title":"Photos","image_url":"https://cosmic-s3.imgix.net/50a66f60-4bc7-11e8-804d-376227a7e98f-sy7VugkQBo0.jpg?w=600","source_code_url":"","url":"https://20b6ef00-5185-11e8-a1e2-bb8ce648f497.cosmicext.com","zip_url":"https://cosmicjs.com/extensions/20b6ef00-5185-11e8-a1e2-bb8ce648f497/src/extension.zip","installed_at":"2018-05-06T23:28:06.039Z","installed_by":"56d66b2f903a79b904000001","font_awesome_class":"fa-camera"}]}}
